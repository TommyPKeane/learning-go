## What is "Go"?

__Go__ is a compiled programming language originally developed by Google which leans heavily towards being a server-side language for web development purposes. Socket, message, and stream handling with __Go__ can be leveraged to manage the backend (Server-side) logic for a web-application.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

Hi, I'm the tommy; it's me. __tommy teaches tommy__ is just a phrase I like to use to summarize, categorize, collect, and explain my personal style of writing for any kinds of tutorial, referential, or theoretical documentation.

<details>
    <summary>More details (ramblings)...</summary>

    <p>
    Outside of the innate narcissism and suspected solipsism, I prefer this phrase as a way to clarify and preface that what I'm sharing and writing is directed at myself as the audience. I'm teaching myself this topic, whether I know it already or not. I want to clarify that because I am preemptively anxiously concerned that my writing-style would otherwise come across as a disrespectful "know it all". I sometimes kinda know what I'm talking about ... that's as much as I'll admit.

    I may know a lot or a little, I may be seeing and saying all this for the first time, or I may have spent decades dealing with this topic. I want that to be a warning to anyone who reads this or references what I'm sharing. I don't say that to mean that I think this is useless; I honestly hope it's useful to anyone who finds this and reads any of this.

    I want to be an advocate for transparency and information. In all honesty, I probably have a neurotic compulsion to want to know and learn everything; but I don't want to hoard any information or knowledge. I think we can all learn everything, and while I'm entertaining (and maybe "enriching"?) myself with all this, I just want to share it openly and transparently. But, again, that's all with the caveat that maybe I got some of this wrong, maybe I misunderstood, or maybe I've talked myself into a false rationalization that I haven't realized yet.

    So, this is __tommy teaches tommy__ -- adverb laden, overly confidently written, and ever-evolving reference materials on various topics with solipsistic priorities.

    But please feel free to use any of this for yourself, and you're more than welcome to reach out if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, corrections, or whatever. Just please also take it all with a bit of safety-conscious cynicism ("trust but verify") before you use any of the information here to do anything important.
